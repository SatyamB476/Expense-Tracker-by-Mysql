FinTrack: OOP-Based Personal Finance Analytics System
📌 Project Overview
FinTrack is a professional-grade personal finance management tool built to solve the practical problem of disorganized expense tracking. Unlike static spreadsheets, this system utilizes a Client-Server Architecture to provide a secure, scalable, and data-driven approach to financial health.

This project demonstrates a strong foundation in Python, SQL, and Data Analytics  by integrating a live MySQL database with automated Pandas analysis and Matplotlib visualizations.

🚀 Key Features

Relational Database Management: Uses a normalized MySQL schema with foreign keys to ensure data integrity.


Object-Oriented Design (OOP): Built with modular Python classes for maintainable and scalable code.



Automated Data Analytics: Leverages Pandas to perform real-time data transformation and aggregation.




Interactive Visualizations: Generates spending distribution reports using Matplotlib.



Professional CLI: A polished Command Line Interface using the tabulate library for structured data reporting.

🛠️ Technical Stack

Language: Python (Primary) 


Database: MySQL (Server-based DBMS) 


Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, MySQL-Connector, Tabulate 



Tools: Git, GitHub, Visual Studio Code 

🏗️ System Architecture
The project follows a 3-Layer Architecture:

Presentation Layer (main.py): An interactive CLI for user input and reporting.


Logic Layer (manager.py): OOP-based controller handling data processing and analytics.



Data Access Layer (database.py): Automated SQL script to initialize schemas and manage persistence.

📊 Analytics Insight
The system doesn't just store data; it interprets it. By selecting the "Generate Visual Analytics" option, users receive a modern, high-fidelity pie chart showing exactly where their money is going, supporting better pricing and inventory-style personal decisions.
